# Configure container to run process as root user
# Note: 
#   The PulseAudio daemon will refuse to start if the $HOME directory is not
#   owned by the user who launched it, _EVEN IF THAT USER IS root_.  So we need
#   to override $HOME to _not_ be /home/retro.  This isn't a big deal because
#   this dir is entirely inside the container anyway (it's not mounted into
#   $local_state) so its name is essentially irrelevant.
