= How can I help?

ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

There are many ways to contribute to this project!

Just by running it and reporting issues (or even letting us know that everything works out of the box) you are helping us!

You don't have to code or understand all the little details of how everything work. Helping us maintain and expand the documentation is another great way to help. Asking questions in the public https://github.com/games-on-whales/gow/discussions[discussion board] is another great way to share knowledge with others.

Feel free to join our https://discord.gg/kRGUDHNHt2[discord server] if you have any question, if you need any help, or you would like to join us on our journey!
