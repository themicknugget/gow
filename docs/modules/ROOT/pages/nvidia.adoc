= NVIDIA GPUs

== Using proprietary drivers

You can see if your host is using the proprietary driver using `lshw`:

[source,bash]
....
$ lshw -class video | grep -i driver
       configuration: driver=nvidia latency=0
....

In order to make use of your GPU inside a docker container, you’ll need
to set up the https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker[NVIDIA Container
Toolkit].

If you have more than one NVIDIA GPU, you may want to set the `GPU_UUID`
variable in `env/nvidia.env` to indicate which card to use.  To get the correct
UUID for your GPU, use the `nvidia-container-cli` command:

[source,bash]
....
$ sudo nvidia-container-cli --load-kmods info
NVRM version:   [version]
CUDA version:   11.3

Device Index:   0
Device Minor:   0
Model:          NVIDIA GeForce [model]
Brand:          GeForce
GPU UUID:       GPU-[uuid]
Bus Location:   00000000:0a:00.0
Architecture:   7.5
....

=== Older NVIDIA GPUs

Older NVIDIA GPUs data might not appear in `nvidia-smi`, but there is a patch
that will fix the issue. For more information, see
https://github.com/CFSworks/nvml_fix

=== Xorg drivers

Although the NVIDIA Container Toolkit automatically provides most of the
drivers needed to use the GPU inside a container, Xorg is _not_ officially
supported. This means that the runtime will not automatically map in the
specific drivers needed by Xorg.

The `run-gow` script attempts to automatically handle this situation for you,
if you tell it you're using an NVIDIA GPU, but under rare circumstances it may
not be able to. If you run into trouble, come chat with us on Discord.

IMPORTANT: You will need to pass the `--gpu nvidia` flag any time you run a
`run-gow` command.

== NVIDIA GPUs with `nouveau` drivers

It should be possible to use the `nouveau` driver, but be aware that this path
is significantly less well-tested than using the proprietary driver.

Make sure that the host doesn’t use proprietary drivers but that it’s
using the open source `nouveau` drivers.

[source,bash]
....
sudo lshw -class video | grep driver=
       configuration: driver=nouveau latency=0
....

Double check that the GPU card is correctly listed under `/dev/dri/`:

[source,bash]
....
ls -la /dev/dri/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root        100 Jun 20 09:47 .
drwxr-xr-x 17 root root       3100 Jun 20 10:33 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root         80 Jun 20 09:47 by-path
crw-rw----  1 root video  226,   0 Jun 20 09:47 card0
crw-rw----  1 root render 226, 128 Jun 20 09:47 renderD128
....

IMPORTANT: Because the `nouveau` driver implements standard APIs, you will
need to make sure you do _not_ pass `--gpu nvidia` when using `run-gow`.
