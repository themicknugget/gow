= Running

Now that you've got your system set up, and GoW installed and configured,
you're ready to launch the system.  Launching GoW is done with the aptly named
`run-gow` script in the install directory.  If you're unsure about what any of
the examples on this page mean, xref:run-gow.adoc[this deep dive] guide should
help to explain things.  Also, if you're using a GPU for hardware acceleration
(and you should!) you may need to provide a `--gpu` option.  See the
xref:run-gow.adoc[deep dive] for details.

== Pulling containers

Now itâ€™s time to download the pre-built container images:

[tabs]
======
Host Desktop::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
run-gow --app [appname] pull
----
--
Headless (incl. unRAID)::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
run-gow --platform headless --app [appname] pull
----
--
======

Currently supported appnames can be found in
https://github.com/games-on-whales/gow/tree/master/compose/apps[our GitHub]
repo, or you can always xref:adding-an-app.adoc[add your own].

This may take a minute or two to complete, since it has to download the
container images.

== Launching

Next, you can launch the system:

[tabs]
======
Host Desktop::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
run-gow --app [appname] up
----
--
Headless (incl. unRAID)::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
run-gow --platform headless --app [appname] up
----
--
======
