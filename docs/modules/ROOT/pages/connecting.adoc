= Connecting

Once the containers are up and running, connect to your server using
https://moonlight-stream.org/[Moonlight]. You may need to manually specify the
IP address of your host system if it isn't automatically discovered.

If this is your first time connecting, you'll need to pair your client and
server.  Moonlight will prompt you with a PIN to enter on the server side.
To validate the PIN you can use the Sunshine web interface (at
`https://<IP>:47990/` default username: `admin`, password: `admin`) or
you can directly call: `curl <IP>:47989/pin/<PIN>`.

After you've completed the pairing step, you can click your host in Moonlight,
then open the `Desktop` app. At this point you should be able to see your X11
apps running!
