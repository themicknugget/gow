= How can I use GOW?

One of the earliest use cases for Games on Whales was to be able to host retro
video games on a central server running RetroArch and stream them to clients
wherever they happened to be.

== Can I use it for something else?
Absolutely! Streaming games works very well, but GoW can do so much more!

Out of the box, GoW provides a platform for running just about any graphical
applications you like.  In fact, despite the name, you can think of GoW as a
low-latency remote desktop solution.  Often the focus is on a single
full-screen application, but this does not necessarily have to be the case.

You should be able to run any Graphical Application on top of the basic
combination of `Xorg` + `PulseAudio` + `Sunshine`.  We supply the necessary
configuration files for `steam`, `retroarch`, and `firefox` by default, but you
can use them as templates to create your own. See
xref:adding-an-app.adoc[Adding an App] for more details.

GoW is even often capable of running containers provided by third parties; as
long as the container can accept a `DISPLAY` environment variable to specify
the Xorg display, it can be made to work.  For example,
https://github.com/andrewmackrodt/dockerfiles/tree/master/firefox-x11[this
Firefox container] (`andrewmackrodt/firefox-x11`) is an open-source Dockerfile
and image. Itâ€™s a great example of running a container which wasnâ€™t built with
GOW in mind.

This container doesnâ€™t need to be run any special privileges or network mode ,
because mouse and keyboard events are handled by `Xorg` and passing the `X11`
socket is enough to have display and inputs.  This increases security for non
trusted containers by restricting what's accessible inside the container.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for gamepads; if your container requires
gamepad support you'll need to use `privileged: true` and `+network_mode:
${UDEVD_NETWORK}+` just like in the RetroArch example.  This is required
because the device files for the gamepad do not exist at the time the container
is launched (they're only created once a client connects) and so far the only
way we've found for a running container to see a newly created device file is
using the `privileged` setting.
