== Kubernetes instructions

TIP: Make sure to checkout the xref:overview.adoc[Overview] first.

=== Requirement

==== Kubernetes

At least version 1.18 is required.

If you are considering a cluster for multiple home applications then
https://github.com/k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s[this template] might
be a good start.

==== uinput

This is a required kernel module in order for Sunshine to manage and
create virtual devices (mouse, joypad, etc.).

Make sure that `/dev/uinput` is present in the Kubernetes nodes where
you intend to run.

[source,bash]
....
ls -la /dev/uinput
crw------- 1 root root 10, 223 Jul 15 11:46 /dev/uinput
....

==== Graphic card

You need to have a graphic card supporting HW acceleration in Xorg.

If you run your Kubernetes workers into a Virtual Machine ensure you
pass it a graphic card. You can use PCI passthrough for this.

=== Quickstart

[source,bash]
....
helm repo add angelnu https://angelnu.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
helm install games-on-whales angelnu/games-on-whales
....

Connect over Moonlight by manually adding the IP address of the worker
node running the Helm chart pod. To validate the PIN you can use the
Sunshine web interface (at `https://<IP>:47990/` username: `admin`,
password is `admin` (at least you changed them in your Helm instance
values) or directly calling: `curl <IP>:47989/pin/<PIN>`.

From Moonlight open the `Desktop` app, from there you should be able to
see your X11 apps running!

=== Next steps

* Adjust your Helm chart settings - see the
https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/angelnu/games-on-whales[instructions]
* Checkout the xref:troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting]
page if anything is not working on your side
* Check out how to configure and use your GPU in order to get HW
acceleration (if you have one)
