= Roadmap

GoW is used by many people to play games and run other graphical applications
every day, including hardware accelerated graphics.  But we've got many more
features and improvements in the pipeline!  Here's a peek at some things we're
working on:

* Expand our list of curated docker containers for popular GUI applications
like: Firefox, Steam, RetroArch, etc.
* Support as many platforms as we can
* Create great documentation so that anybody can understand and learn from this
project
* Make a _``launcher app''_ that will let users start/stop other GUI containers
_easily_
* Much more!
